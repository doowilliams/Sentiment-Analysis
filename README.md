Natural Language Processing - Airline Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

## Business Context

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become a prominent channel for customers to share their experiences and opinions, and the airline industry is no exception. Passengers frequently turn to Twitter to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to their air travel. The ease of access and immediacy of social media has empowered customers to voice their opinions in real-time, making it a valuable source of feedback for airlines. The airline company recognized the immense value of these insights to understand customer sentiment and continuously enhance the travel experience.

However, the airline company faces a significant challenge with the rise of negative feedback on social media. Negative sentiments expressed by customers become a crucial problem to solve as they can lead to several detrimental effects, including:

1. Customer Churn: Unaddressed negative sentiment can lead to customer dissatisfaction and ultimately result in passengers choosing competitors for their future travel needs. This translates to a loss of loyal customers, impacting long-term revenue and market share.

2. Reputation Damage: Persistent negative sentiment, if left unmanaged, can tarnish an airline's reputation, and influence potential passengers to avoid booking with the airline. A damaged reputation can have lasting consequences, affecting brand loyalty and trust.

3. Financial Loss: Loss of revenue can occur if negative sentiment drives passengers away, impacting the airline's profitability and long-term success. Negative feedback can discourage potential passengers from making bookings with the airline, leading to direct financial repercussions
